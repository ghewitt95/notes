## Blog Draft (INTRO)

  Before starting off in this program, I was only confident in two languages, HTML and CSS. I was not confident in any programming language and thought that learning one of them would be impossible. I did have a history in learning JavaScript, But I could barely make a simple calculator app by the end of the cohort I was originally a part of. After a couple months of frustration, I completely quit learning to code altogether. It wasn't until moving to Chicago 

  ## personal feedback

  after typing this in the morning and coming back to it, I don't like the idea of doing a blog about this topic until I'm a tiny bit more comfortable with the Ruby language.
